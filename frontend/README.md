# FoodDelivery FrontEnd

The frontend is written in ReasonReact, lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code with great interop with JavaScript.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run server
# in a new tab
npm start
```

Open a new web page to `http://localhost:8000/`. Change any `.re` file in `src` to see the page auto-reload. **You don't need any bundler when you're developing**!
